Hypolit is an experimental web application to learn how to use PerlDancer.


Plan:

The first part I am planning to create is a bookmark repository where 
I can save my bookmarks and share with the public some of them.

It will also have an API and I am going to implement a set of client libraries.
That will be useful for both testing and for people to integrate it into other
applications.
